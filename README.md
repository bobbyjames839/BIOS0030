# Memory test

This test is designed to test the memory of the user. There are 3 different levels to the test - easy, medium and hard. Each level displays a grid and then asks the user 5 different multiple-choice questions based on the grid. 

The test score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of the user. Once the user has completed the test, their score is compared to others through my Firebase database.

Consent for users to have their data used, the test will crash if not
Store functions in another file
Ensure the user inputs the correct code format at the start by giving them an error if it is wrong
